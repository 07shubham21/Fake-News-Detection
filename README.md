# Fake-News-Detection
Model that differentiate Reliable and Unreliable news article.

This repository contains code for a fake news detection project. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content. Fake news has become a significant issue in today's society, with misinformation spreading rapidly across social media platforms and other online channels. By building accurate fake news detection models, we aim to help users identify unreliable information sources and combat the spread of misinformation.

Features
1. Data Preprocessing: The project includes code for preprocessing text data, including techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.

2. Machine Learning Models: We have implemented various machine learning algorithms for fake news detection, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

3. Evaluation Metrics: The performance of each model is evaluated using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



   Dataset:

The project uses a publicly available dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
